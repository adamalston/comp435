Detecting Duplicates


For this assignment you will be detecting duplicate hex values in a large text file. You will sort
them by value and then display how many duplicates are present. For example, let’s say you have the following text file name “sample.txt”:
9ec4c12949a4f31474f299058ce2b22a
9ec4c12949a4f31474f299058ce2b22a
43
aa
02
123
acd
aa
123
123
02


Your program should parse through the entire file, and for each value that is in the file more than
once, it should print out the number of instances of that value. In this case the correct output will
be:
2 2
aa 2
123 3
9ec4c12949a4f31474f299058ce2b22a 2


Note that the output is sorted from the smallest value to the largest value in hex. 
Also note that leading zeros are omitted even if they were present in the input. 
Your program must take in the file to read as a command line argument.
